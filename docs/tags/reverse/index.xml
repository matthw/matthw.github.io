      <title>Automatically Unpacking IcedID Stage 1 with Angr</title>

      <description>It started with 0verfl0w posting a small challenge on the Zero 2 Automated discord server asking to automatically extract the configuration of an unpacked IcedID sample (0581f0bf260a11a5662d58b99a82ec756c9365613833bce8f102ec1235a7d4f7).
Unpacking the sample was part of the exercise but could be done manually as a one shot, however the more I looked into the stager, the more i thought an automated unpacker would be a fun thing to do.
I&amp;rsquo;ll skip over some details of the stager (like API hashing and injection) to focus only on the unpacking part.</description>

      <description>I recently had to buy a new 24x1G fanless switch for my home network. I had a mikrotik switch for years (which i was happy with but suffered a power surge) and wanted to try something new so I ended up with a FS S3700-24T4F.
Their CLI is close to Cisco&amp;rsquo;s IOS, it&amp;rsquo;s overall a fun device for home network and not too expensive. Found few small bugs here and there without really looking for them but in the end nothing too annoying in my context.</description>
