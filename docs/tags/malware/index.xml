      <description>It started with 0verfl0w posting a small challenge on the Zero 2 Automated discord server asking to automatically extract the configuration of an unpacked IcedID sample (0581f0bf260a11a5662d58b99a82ec756c9365613833bce8f102ec1235a7d4f7).
Unpacking the sample was part of the exercise but could be done manually as a one shot, however the more I looked into the stager, the more i thought an automated unpacker would be a fun thing to do.
I&amp;rsquo;ll skip over some details of the stager (like API hashing and injection) to focus only on the unpacking part.</description>
