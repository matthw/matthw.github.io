      <description>&amp;ldquo;serpentine&amp;rdquo; was the 9th and penultimate challenge from Google/FLARE&amp;rsquo;s Flare-On 2024 - and arguably the hardest challenge of these past couple of years (at least in my opinion).&#xA;Some information may be presented in a simplistic or incomplete way, as I tried to stay focused on the main points for this challenge. However, itâ€™s very possible I got something slightly wrong or made a mistake, so feel free to point it out.</description>

      <description>These are two self-debugging ptrace (or nanomite, as you prefer) based challenges I made for 0xl4augh CTF.&#xA;ptrace is a system call that allows a process to trace/debug another process, it is used by debuggers and tracing tools like strace.&#xA;Since it can be used to read/write the memory and the CPU context of another process, it can also be used for all kind of fun stuff like hot patching.</description>

      <description>BarbHack 2023 had some pretty cool reversing challenges. I could not attend the conf, so i solved them afterwards (not sure i would have time to solve this one during the CTF anyway).&#xA;This writeup is about illusion.exe, a fun binary by sar - thanks to him for providing it to me afterwards and allowing me to host it here :)&#xA;1. Clicky click if we run the binary it just produces this output and exits:</description>

      <description>Grey Cat The Flag CTF 2023 had some nice reversing challenges, this one was very nice and i think deserves a small writeup.&#xA;You can grab the original file here. A fixed version was later released fixed, but i used the original binary.&#xA;1. Quick Recon it&amp;rsquo;s a 64 bits ELF that takes the flag as input&#xA;% file crackme2 crackme2: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.</description>

      <description>This is a 32 bit PE file using an interesting trick.&#xA;You can grab the file here.&#xA;1. Quick Recon Opening the file in ghidra and navigating from the entry point to the main function we find something like:&#xA;if (argc &amp;lt; 2) { printf(&amp;#34;Usage: %s &amp;lt;flag&amp;gt;\n&amp;#34;,(char)*argv); /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */ exit(1); } f = argv[1]; argv1 = f + 1; do { cVar1 = *f; f = f + 1; } while (cVar1 !</description>

      <description>This was one of the reversing challenge during Square CTF, i found it interesting and unusual as it involves YARA.&#xA;1. Description Supposedly this file can recognize a flag. But what could it be?&#xA;2. Introduction The file given is a compiled YARA rule.&#xA;From their website:&#xA;YARA is a tool aimed at (but not limited to) helping malware researchers to identify and classify malware samples. With YARA you can create descriptions of malware families (or whatever you want to describe) based on textual or binary patterns.</description>
