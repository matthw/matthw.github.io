There&amp;rsquo;s often shortcuts taken and (un)educated guesses involved, some ugly Z3 and angr for additionnal fun&amp;hellip;

      <description>I recently had to buy a new 24x1G fanless switch for my home network. I had a mikrotik switch for years (which i was happy with but suffered a power surge) and wanted to try something new so I ended up with a FS S3700-24T4F.
Their CLI is close to Cisco&amp;rsquo;s IOS, it&amp;rsquo;s overall a fun device for home network and not too expensive. Found few small bugs here and there without really looking for them but in the end nothing too annoying in my context.</description>

      <description>Malwarebytes released their 3rd crackme, here&amp;rsquo;s my entry for the writeup contest.
You can find the original announcement here and the contest summary here.
0. First Look Running the crackme, we understand we&amp;rsquo;ll be asked to find 3 passwords. Only the first button is enabled, so they will most likely need to be found in order
Loading the binary into PE-bear reveals it&amp;rsquo;s a Dot Net binary
so let&amp;rsquo;s open it in dnSpy</description>
